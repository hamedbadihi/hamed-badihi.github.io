<h2>Postdoctoral Researcher:</h2>

<p>Stay tuned for upcoming positions! </p>

<h2>Doctoral Researcher:</h2>
  
<p>We have a Doctoral Researcher position in “Advanced Control for Resilient Cyber-Physical Renewable Energy Systems.” This represents an exciting opportunity to engage in innovative research at the intersection of advanced control systems, cyber-physical systems, and renewable energies (wind, solar, microgrids, etc.)</p>
<p><b>Job description:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>As renewable energy systems are becoming increasingly digital, smarter, interconnected and thus more efficient, they are facing new and complex challenges related to their physical and cyber components. Due to these rapid evolutions and the new threats of cyber-attacks, these systems’ physical and cyber resilience must be improved. In response to these challenges, the successful candidate for this Doctoral Researcher position will engage in cutting-edge research to develop novel control schemes that are uniquely designed to be both fault-tolerant and attack-resilient. The focus will be on integrating advanced reinforcement learning and adaptive control techniques to enable real-time control adaptation and system reconfiguration. The goal is to proactively address and mitigate the impacts of faults and cyber-attacks before they escalate into major disruptions. This research is crucial for enhancing the resilience and reliability of renewable energy systems, fostering greater trust and wider adoption. Such advancements are key to increasing investments in these technologies, essential in the global effort to combat climate change and secure a sustainable energy future. The position also involves collaboration within a multidisciplinary team to push the boundaries of current knowledge and technology in this field, publishing research findings in reputable journals, presenting at international conferences, and possibly including a few months of mobility to a Canadian partner during the research stages for collaborative work.</p>
  </li>  
</ul>
<p><b>Requirements:</b></p>
<p>Applicants are expected to meet the following criteria:</p>
